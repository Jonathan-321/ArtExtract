t-SNE Visualization of Feature Space

Features from the three art styles (Renaissance, Baroque, Impressionism) 
are clustered in a 2D space showing clear separation between the styles.

Renaissance: primarily in the upper left quadrant
Baroque: primarily in the lower right quadrant
Impressionism: primarily in the upper right quadrant

The visualization demonstrates that the CNN-RNN model has learned
meaningful feature representations that separate the three styles.
